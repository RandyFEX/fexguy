# CLAUDE.md — FEXGUY.com

Astro (TypeScript, static output) site deployed on Vercel. Rebuild of the
live WordPress site at fexguy.com. Phase 1 (exact migration of 334 live URLs)
is in place; see src/content/README.md for how pages were migrated.

## Hard rules

- **Never invent business facts**: no insurance claims, carriers, prices,
  rates, licensing/state info, statistics, testimonials, reviews, awards,
  addresses, phone numbers, or page copy. Use only content Randy provides.
  If something is missing, leave the field empty and ask.
- **Never guess WordPress URLs or redirects.** Only use URLs from the
  migration data Randy provides.
- Don't connect domains, change DNS, or set `PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true`
  unless Randy explicitly asks. Never touch the production WordPress site.
- Phase 1 is an exact migration: don't change any migrated page's URL,
  title, meta description, H1, body content, robots, canonical, social
  tags, or JSON-LD without Randy's approval.
- Don't build forms, quoters, call buttons, tracking, or other lead-generation
  functionality until Randy approves the lead-system plan.
- Redirects must be approved by Randy before they're added to vercel.json.
- Keep pages static. Don't add an SSR adapter, a CSS framework, web fonts, or
  client-side frameworks without a clear reason: speed and Core Web Vitals
  come first.

## Where things go

- Business details, phone, nav menus, default CTA: `src/config/site.ts`
- Pages: Markdown files in `src/content/pages/` (path = URL; `index.md` is
  the homepage). Template: `src/content/_templates/page.example.md`.
  Schema: `src/content.config.ts`. Rendered by `src/layouts/ContentLayout.astro`.
- Images: `public/wp-content/uploads/` (original WordPress paths).
- Redirects: `vercel.json` → `redirects`.
- Structured data: migrated pages carry verbatim JSON-LD in frontmatter
  (`jsonLd`). For new pages, builders live in `src/lib/seo/schema.ts`.
- Colors/spacing: CSS custom properties at the top of `src/styles/global.css`.

## Conventions

- Exactly one `<h1>` per page, inside the page body.
- Components that depend on unset config render nothing. Keep that pattern.
- Mobile-first CSS: base styles for small screens, `min-width` queries up.
  Touch targets ≥ 44px (`--tap-target`).
- URLs use trailing slashes (`trailingSlash: 'always'`, matched in vercel.json).

## Before committing

Run `npm run check` and `npm run build`. Both must pass with 0 errors.
